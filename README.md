# Candle
CANDLE is software for deep learning at scale. In the early stages, the software is being developed for execution on the Department of Energy's leadership computing resources. However, in theory the software can execute on any reasonably configured cluster.

This repository serves as a place for system level documents, tests, and other artifacts that span multiple modules in the system.
